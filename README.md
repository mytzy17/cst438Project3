### Iteration 1

**User Story:** Set up backend functionality by Roober:
> I started out with setting up the index.js file that uses Express JS for the handling
> of routes. I also set up the back end code for creating a new account/registering and logging in.

### Iteration 2

**User Story:** Set up basic question manipulation in admin by Roober:
> I started the basic functionality of how an admin might interact with the questions in the database
> and created an add and delete function for the admin to add or delete questions.
> I also added a view questions modal window that displays all questions in the database.

### Iteration 3

**User Story:** Landing page and starting quiz by Roober:
> Over the 3rd iteration and part of thanksgiving, I worked on the basic backend functionality
of the landing page which included two buttons, user profile and take quiz. The take quiz button
opens up a modal where you can choose your options. I also implemented the quiz page along with the 
submission of the quiz to the DB.

### Iteration 4

**User Story:** Rearranging things, quiz Results, and file upload by Roober:
> For this last iteration, I decided to clean up our main file, index.js and move most of the
code into different routes. I also made a results page after quiz submission that shows 
what questions a user got wrong and what they got right along with a percentage 
which will be stored into the DB. I also implemented a file upload for images for
the user's profile picture.
